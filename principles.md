# Network Design Principles

## Entity Selection Criteria

**Power threshold:** Only individuals/entities with significant influence over capital, technology, or markets

**Network density:** Prioritize highly-connected nodes that bridge multiple clusters

**Current relevance:** Focus on active players, not historical figures

**Scale requirement:** Entities must operate at billion-dollar+ scale or equivalent influence

## Relationship Mapping

**Direct connections only:** No inferred or speculative relationships

**High-signal relationships:** Employment, ownership, investment, founding - not social acquaintances

**Temporal relevance:** Current relationships weighted over historical ones

**Bidirectional where appropriate:** "knows" vs "works_for" vs "invests_in"

## Graph Structure

**Avoid over-indexing on any single entity:** No ego networks around individuals

**Maintain cluster balance:** Tech, finance, traditional business proportionally represented

**Connection quality over quantity:** Better to have fewer, stronger relationships

**Real power mapping:** Follow money flows and decision-making authority

## Relationship Types (Standardized)

- `founder_of` / `employee_of` / `ex_employee_of`
- `works_for` / `worked_for` / `worked_with`
- `invests_in` / `owns_equity_in`
- `knows` / `acquaintance`

## Exclusion Rules

**No celebrities without business power**

**No academics unless commercialized influence**

**No politicians unless direct business crossover**

**No family connections unless business-relevant**

**No consultants or advisors without equity stakes**

**No new entity types** - Use existing: person, company, fund only

## Data Integrity

**Verify through multiple sources**

**Update for major changes** (new roles, acquisitions)

**Remove entities that lose relevance**

**Consolidate redundant entries**

---

**The goal:** Map actual power flows in the global economy, not social networks or org charts.
