# Network Expansion Plan

## Current Network Analysis

**Entity Count:** 100+ entities (person/company/fund)
**Relationship Types:** 8 standardized types
**Geographic Coverage:** Heavy US tech bias, limited international
**Densest Cluster:** PayPal mafia network
**Coverage Gaps:** European finance, Asian conglomerates, critical infrastructure

## Expansion Strategy

### Core Principles

**Entity Selection Threshold**
- Billion-dollar+ decision-making authority
- Direct control over capital/technology/market access
- Active players only (exclude historical figures)
- Cross-cluster bridge potential

**Relationship Integrity**
- Maintain existing 8 relationship types
- Direct connections only (no speculation)
- Current relationships > historical relationships
- Multi-source verification required

**Quality Controls**
- Maximum 20 new entities per month
- Quarterly relevance reviews
- Connection verification mandatory
- Prevent single-entity over-indexing

- Palmer Luckey → Anduril (founder_of)
- Anthony Tan → Grab (founder_and_ceo_of)
- Alphabet → DeepMind (owns_equity_in)
- Amazon → Anthropic (invests_in)

## Implementation Mechanics

### Monthly Process
1. **Week 1:** Entity research and verification
2. **Week 2:** Relationship mapping
3. **Week 3:** Network integration and testing
4. **Week 4:** Quality review and documentation

### Focus Capabilities to Implement
- Entity type filtering (person/company/fund)
- Connection degree visualization (1st/2nd/3rd degree)
- Geographic clustering
- Industry sector isolation
- Investment flow tracking
- Timeline-based relationship viewing

### Data Quality Metrics
- Connection verification rate: >95%
- Entity relevance score: Updated quarterly
- Cross-source confirmation: Minimum 2 sources
- Relationship currency: <12 months old

### Exclusion Criteria
- Celebrities without business power
- Academics without commercialized influence
- Politicians without direct business crossover
- Family connections unless business-relevant
- Consultants/advisors without equity stakes

## Success Metrics

**Coverage Quality**
- Geographic distribution: <60% US entities
- Sector balance: Tech/Finance/Traditional roughly equal
- Connection density: Average 3+ connections per entity
- Power concentration: No single entity >10% of total connections

**Network Utility**
- Cross-cluster bridges identified
- Single points of failure mapped
- Capital flow pathways traced
- Decision-making bottlenecks visible

**Update Frequency**
- Major role changes: Within 30 days
- New IPOs/acquisitions: Within 60 days
- Quarterly relevance review: Remove stale entities
- Annual comprehensive audit

## Risk Mitigation

**Data Integrity**
- Multiple source verification
- Regular connection audits
- Bias monitoring (geographic/sector)
- Outdated relationship removal

**Network Balance**
- Prevent ego networks around individuals
- Maintain cluster proportionality
- Avoid over-representation of single companies
- Balance historical vs current relationships

**Operational Constraints**
- Monthly addition limits
- Quality over quantity emphasis
- Regular pruning of irrelevant entities
- Focus on actual power flows vs social connections
